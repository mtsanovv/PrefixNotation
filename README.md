# PrefixNotation
Simple prefix notation implementation in Perl. Created as an assignment for one my courses at TU-Sofia.

## Notes
- The polishNotationConverter is actually a perl script - you can use perl polishNotationConverter to run it. Additionally, if your perl is located in /usr/bin/perl and you grant execute permissions to polishNotationConverter, you can run it simply by using ./polishNotationConverter.
